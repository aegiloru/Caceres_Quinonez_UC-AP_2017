Summary:
Among the application areas of wireless networks of sensors and actuators (WSAN), agriculture presents extremely attractive scenarios for the application of this technology. Its use, along with good agricultural practices, allows higher profits crop.
This research reviews the state of the art of applying WSANs in agricultural fields, success stories, perspectives and challenges. Based on this analysis, and focusing on crops inside hydroponics greenhouses, physical phenomena, regarding cooling, dehumidification, heating, nutrient dosing and illumination processes are studied.
Given these requirements, the design of a WSAN architecture applicable for hydroponic greenhouses is proposed, analyzing for this purpose types of sensors required, and market available platforms. The Contiki operative system, ideal for low power devices, along with the Cooja simulator, are emphasized to develop an application for collecting acquired data from sensors, process this information and cast it over the network. Moreover, using an innovative technology such as 6LoWPAN is considered, given that it is conceived for a better integration between WSANs and the internet, focusing on the IoT (Internet of Things) model.
Results obtained through practiced simulations show that the use of a WSAN as a communications platform for a greenhouse is applicable. For this, first, processes that take place inside it were studied, such as air conditioning and dehumidification, using mathematical models provided in bibliographical references, in order to identify the temporal requirements to which the performance of the WSAN has to be adjusted. Later, WSAN simulations were executed, verifying that its performance in terms of latency are adjusted to the requirements of controlling processes.
